Kant is a small language with dependent types, written to explore possible ways
to implement a core language supporting
[observational equality](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~txa/publ/obseqnow.pdf).

Current features include:

  * User defined data types and records
  * Implicit universe hierarchy
  * Bidirectional type checking for abstractions
  * Type holes

Planned features are:

  * Observational equality
  * Inference via pattern unification

Other 'possible' features:

  * Pattern matching
  * Corecursion

## Brief overview

### Syntax

The syntax goes more or less like this:

### Data types and records

Data types are defined like so: ...

### Abstract variables

...

### Type holes

...

### Type hierarchy

...
